## Overview

This project was created for the [Etch-a-Sketch assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project allows users to draw on a grid by moving their mouse over the cells.
